# ChatGPT-Swing

**[中文](https://linweiyuan.github.io/2023/02/25/ChatGPT-Swing.html)**

**ChatGPT-Swing** is an unofficial GUI using Java Swing technology and is based on the web version of
ChatGPT (3.5) rather than the public GPT-3 API.

With this program, you can do almost everything that can be done on the web version, like:

- make conversation (support context association)
- delete conversation
- rename conversation title
- clear all conversations
- give a feedback (thumbsUp or thumbsDown) on response
- speech-to-text (using Free TTS API for testing with an IP based limitation of 6000 tokens per week)

The API for this application is available [here](https://github.com/linweiyuan/go-chatgpt-api)
or [here](https://github.com/linweiyuan/chatgptapi), you can build and deploy your own in supported
countries, both of them can bypass Cloudflare v2 CAPTCHA in a special way.

**Please note: this is an unofficial application using unofficial APIs, maybe unavailable at any time.**
